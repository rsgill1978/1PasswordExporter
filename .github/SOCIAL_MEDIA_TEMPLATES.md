🧵 Why I built a free 1Password → Apple Passwords migration tool:

   • Credit cards
   • Secure notes
   • Attachments

4/ Works on Mac, Windows, Linux. Just Python 3.6+, no installs needed

5/ Open source (MIT). Audit the code yourself: [link]

6/ Takes 5 minutes total. Export → Run script → Import

🔐 Built a Free Tool for Password Manager Migration

As more people move to Apple's new Passwords app (free with macOS Sequoia and iOS 18), I noticed there was no good migration tool from 1Password.

So I built one. And made it open source.

What it does:
✅ Exports passwords, TOTP codes, credit cards, secure notes
✅ Preserves ALL data including file attachments
✅ Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
✅ Zero external dependencies

Why this matters:
→ Apple Passwords is free (no $36-60/year subscription)
→ Native integration with Apple ecosystem
→ Privacy-focused with iCloud sync
→ This tool makes migration painless

The tool is MIT licensed and available on GitHub. Perfect for:
• Individuals wanting to save on subscriptions
• Families using Apple devices
• Privacy advocates
• Anyone wanting password vault backups

Title: [Tool] Free & Open-Source 1Password to Apple Passwords Migrator

I created a tool to help people migrate from 1Password to Apple Passwords without data loss.

**Why this matters for privacy:**
- Apple Passwords is free and privacy-focused (E2E encryption, on-device processing)
- No subscriptions = less financial tracking
- Open source = audit the code yourself
- Keeps your data out of third-party tools

**What it exports:**
- All passwords with TOTP/2FA codes
- Credit cards, secure notes, identities
- File attachments
- Works offline (no cloud processing)

The tool is MIT licensed, uses only Python standard library (no sketchy dependencies), and works on all platforms.

Would love feedback from the community! Also happy to answer technical questions.

Title: Show HN: Free Tool to Migrate from 1Password to Apple Passwords

URL: [GitHub link]

With Apple Passwords now free in macOS 15+ and iOS 18+, many are looking to switch from paid password managers like 1Password ($36-60/year).

The problem: No official migration tool exists, and manual CSV export loses data (TOTP codes, attachments, structured data).

I built a Python script that:
- Parses 1Password's .1pux export format
- Converts to Apple Passwords-compatible CSV
- Extracts all attachments and non-password items
- Preserves TOTP/2FA codes
- Works on any platform with Python 3.6+

It's MIT licensed, uses only standard library (no dependencies), and handles large vaults (tested with 1000+ items).

The whole migration takes ~5 minutes: Export from 1Password → Run script → Import to Apple Passwords.

Happy to answer questions about the .1pux format, Apple Passwords CSV requirements, or the implementation!
